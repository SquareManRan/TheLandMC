## Connecting to the Server

If you would like to join and play on the server:

- First, message Ran#3086 on discord to be whitelisted on the server.
- Make sure you are using the same Minecraft version as the server, at the time of making this, we are in 1.19.2
- If you are a bedrock player, head over to your platform under the bedrock dropdown.
- The IP address for the Minecraft server is: `thelandmc.us.to`

## Rules

1. No cheating. This includes xray and baritone, as well as cheat clients or other third party software designed to give you an advantage over other players.
2. No hate speech or discrimination.
3. No unnecessary griefing. Simple enough, don't destroy or steal other player's property.
4. No unnecessary killing. Banter with your friends is fine though if it's agreed upon.
5. Basically just don't be an ass.
6. Foghorn.mp3

## Bedrock

We use a mod called [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) that translates bedrock players' incoming and outgoing data so that it can be read and processed by the java server.
Beware there are few known inconsistencies, the main one being that certain crafting recipies sadly don't seem to work for bedrock players on the server. A few recipe examples are redstone comparators, sticky pistons, and hoppers.

## Extra Features

- We use many performance-enhancing mods on the server to keep the lag down, and the fun up. A couple of those being [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric), and [Starlight](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight)
- Extremely configurable and positionable armor stands, head over to its section under `Features` for more info.
- Crafting tables have hopper support, meaning you can hook them up to complex redstone circuits and have them craft items automatically in farms and such. Head over to the `Auto Crafting` tab under `Features` for more info.
- Deepslate and logs are able to be insta-mined on this server. For more information on the necessary steps to achieve this, head over to the `Deepslate / Logs Instamine` tab under `Features`.
