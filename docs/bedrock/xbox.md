# Xbox

This documentation on how to connect to our java server on an xbox is based off of [this tutorial video](https://youtu.be/g8mHvasVHMs), which you can watch for a visual representation on your directions.

Note: This will not affect anything about how your internet works on your xbox in any way, it just allows you to connect to our server.

To configure your xbox and connect to the bedrock server:

1. Go to your Xbox settings
2. Network > then network settings
3. Advanced settings
4. DNS settings > Manual
5. Next you will see 4 boxes separated by periods, in there you need to type in `104`.`238`.`130`.`180` and press enter
6. Next, you will be presented with another 4 boxes looking the same. Here you should type in `8`.`8`.`8`.`8` then press enter
7. After this, it should take you back to your `Advanced Settings` section
8. At this screen, wait a few seconds, and your xbox may or may not run a connection check. If you did everything right, this check will return a message: "It's all good. Your console is connected to the Internet."

Congratulations! Your Xbox is now properly configured to allow you to connect to our server (or any other java server running geyser for that matter).

To actually add and connect to our server from minecraft, do the following:

1. Press `play`, then press `servers`
2. Connect to any of the "Featured Servers" in the top section of the list
3. Once you connect to that large server, a menu will pop up allowing you to add a server of your choosing
4. From this new menu, (which you have access to because of the setting applied a few moments ago) press the `Connect to a Server` button
5. This will switch you to a new window. Type `ops233.duckdns.org` into the `Server Address` bar, and leave the port as `19132`, which is what it should be by default
6. To more easily connect to the server in the future, tick the `Add to server list` option on at the bottom of the menu
7. Press submit to connect to the server and play!
