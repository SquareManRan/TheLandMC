# Switch

This documentation on how to connect to our java server on a Switch is based off of [this tutorial video](https://youtu.be/zalT_oR1nPM), which you can watch for a visual representation on your directions.

Note: This will not affect anything about how your internet works on your Switch in any way, it just allows you to connect to our server.

To configure your Switch and connect to the bedrock server:

1. From your home page, click on the `System Settings` icon on the bottom
2. Go to Internet > then Internet Settings
3. Click on your wifi network, then `Change Settings`
4. Scroll down a few options and click on `DNS Settings`, then choose the `Manual` option
5. Click `Primary DNS`, and enter: `104`.`238`.`130`.`180` and press `OK`
6. Click `Secondary DNS`, and enter: `8`.`8`.`8`.`8` and press `OK`
7. Press the `Save` button, then `OK`

If you did it right, you should not be able to connect to our Java server and play.
To do so:

1. From Minecraft's main screen, press `play`, then press `servers`
2. Connect to any of the "Featured Servers" in the top section of the list
3. Once you connect to that large server, a menu will pop up allowing you to add a server of your choosing
4. From this new menu, (which you have access to because of the setting applied a few moments ago) press the `Connect to a Server` button
5. This will switch you to a new window. Type `thelandmc.us.to` into the `Server Address` bar, and leave the port as `19132`, which is what it should be by default
6. To more easily connect to the server in the future, tick the `Add to server list` option on at the bottom of the menu
7. Press submit to connect to the server and play!
